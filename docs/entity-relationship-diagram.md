# Entity-Relationship Diagram

## Appointment Booking Platform Data Structure

Please note that this is currently the **unencrypted data model**. Appointments, Notes, Attachments and Answers of course have to be encrypted before being stored in the database.

## Database Architecture Notes

- **Multi-tenancy**: Each tenant operates with a separate database instance
- **No explicit tenant references**: Since each tenant has its own database, foreign key relationships don't need to reference the tenant
- **Encryption**: The system uses end-to-end encryption with public/private key pairs for clients and staff
- **Hash-based identification**: Both clients and staff are identified by hash keys derived from their credentials
- **Flexible appointments**: Appointments support multiple notes and attachments for comprehensive record keeping
